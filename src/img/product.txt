UX design
Simple answer:
User Experience (UX) designers conduct
research, create prototypes, and develop designs 
based on the research and user data.
The goal of the research is to better 
understand user behavior

UX design deals with all aspects of a user’s experience
 (UX) with digital products, including the way the product
 makes them think and feel. If you enjoy your time with a
 site or app and you can easily achieve what you want
 with it, that’s thanks to good website design and UX.

"To be a UX designer, you need an understanding of people and how 
they think; enjoy problem 
solving, think critically and possess strong attention to details"

Instead of manually iterating over the array using a loop, you can simply use the built-in Array.map() method.

The Array.map() method allows you to iterate over an array and modify its elements using a callback function. The callback function will then be executed on each of the array's elements.

For example, suppose you have the following array element:
Now imagine you are required to multiply each of the array's elements by 3. You might consider using a for loop as follows:
let arr = [3, 4, 5, 6];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
  arr[i] = arr[i] * 3;
}

console.log(arr); // [9, 12, 15, 18]

UI
UI, or user interaction design, focuses particularly on 
the aspects of a website or application that users see and 
interact with (menus and buttons), color and typography, 
page or screen layout, animations, and physical actions
 (clicks and swipes). UI designers focus on visual design 
and are graphic designers. As visual design impacts the way
 a user experiences a product,
 UI is a subset of UX which covers all aspects of a user’s experience.
